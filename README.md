# Web Development Project 2 - Star Wars Trivia

Submitted by: Ahmed Azmi

This web app: Star Wars Trivia is a trivia game intended for people (fans of the franchise or not!) to test their Star Wars knowledge through a flashcard game. I used the React hook UseState to add functionality/interactivity to the next button, as well as allowing the flashcard to flip between 'question' and answer.

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The title of the card set and some information about it, such as a short description and the total number of cards are displayed**
- [x] **A single card at a time is displayed, only showing one of the components of the information pair**
- [x] **A list of card pairs is created**
- [x] **Clicking on the card shows the corresponding component of the information pair**
- [x] **Clicking the next button displays a random new card**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Cards contains images in addition to or in place of text
- [ ] Cards have different visual styles such as color based on their category
  - [ ] *visual style implemented*

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
It was really hard to conceptualize and translate how I learned UseState during the WEB102 session as well as the Bro Code youtube video I watched (lol), but once I compared it to the in class activity I realized it wasn't so bad, and that I just had to start by creating a dictionary with the characters list. Then, figuring out how to navigate that list with useState was relatively straightforward.
